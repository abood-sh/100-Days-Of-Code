### Day 002: March 02, 2020 MON

**Today's Progress:**  
Implementing the express-ejs-layouts package üëçüèº, and focus on the front-end views today. Sort out the landing page's layout using the CSS grid. Research on RESTful API and MVC architecture, see if I can implementing it in this small project.  

**Thoughts:** CSS grid is way more easy to use than flexbox?! Took me awhile try to use flex, but somethings just not right so eventually, I just switch to use grid...!

### Day 011: March 11, 2020 WED

- Climbing the LeaderBoard
- Viral Advertising
- Beautiful Days at the Movies
- Angry Professor
- Utopian Tree
- Designer PDF Viewer
- The Hurdle Race

Back with Hackerrank challenges! Today I got stuck with the "Climbing the LeaderBoard" challenge for quite some time...! My logic is right but 4 of the sample keep getting runtime error, after some googling it had something to do with "Big O notation". Cuz I was looping one array inside another array which is O(n * n), it will slow down when n gets too big...?! Anyway, still not fully understanding the concept yet, but I know I need to somehow loop through both array at the same time to compare them. So, I finally found that I can do this:

```javascript
// loop both array in nested for loop  
// but put both starting point on the outside loop  
for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < n; n++) {
    for (; j < m; j++) {
        // code goes here...
    }
}
// this way j will not reset every time i go up!
```

totally did not know I can do that...! üòÖ

Today I also finished my PS5 product landing page for freeCodeCamp's project. It was fun!

**Thoughts:**  Need to find better tutorial to get the "Big O notation" concept!! ü§î

- Take a Number And Sum Its Digits Raised To The Consecutive Powers And ....¬°Eureka!!

**Thoughts:** Today I went through a bunch YouTube tutorials to see which front-end framework should I start learning. **React.js** vs **Vue.js** ? ü§îI decided to try **Vue.js** first because it actually seems much friendly to beginners. Cuz you can still just write in HTML & CSS, and not suddenly jump to write everything inside JS. 

P.S. The Net Ninja's "[Vue JS 2 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQcYgjhBoeQH7wiAyZNrYa)" seems pretty easy to grasp!!!

Maybe I can start try to implements those function I solved into some kinda small webapp? Like some simple calculations?!
