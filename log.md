### Day 001: March 01, 2020 SUN

**Today's Progress:** Started a new project with node.js and set up the project folder structure. Sorted out the DB connection and HTML skeleton.

### Day 002: March 02, 2020 MON

**Today's Progress:** Implementing the express-ejs-layouts package üëçüèº, and focus on the front-end views today. Sort out the landing page's layout using the CSS grid. Research on RESTful API and MVC architecture, see if I can implementing it in this small project.  

**Thoughts:** CSS grid is way more easy to use than flexbox?! Took me awhile try to use flex, but somethings just not right so eventually, I just switch to use grid...!
