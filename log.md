### Day 002: March 02, 2020 MON

**Today's Progress:**  
Implementing the express-ejs-layouts package üëçüèº, and focus on the front-end views today. Sort out the landing page's layout using the CSS grid. Research on RESTful API and MVC architecture, see if I can implementing it in this small project.  

**Thoughts:** CSS grid is way more easy to use than flexbox?! Took me awhile try to use flex, but somethings just not right so eventually, I just switch to use grid...!

**Today's Progress:**  
Found a npm package called [popular-movie-quotes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/popular-movie-quotes) which I use it to generate random movie quote on my landing page. üòú And then I work on how to get the Date in js and show it on the page in the format I want.

### Day 011: March 11, 2020 WED

**Today's Progress:**  
Problems solved on Hackerrank: 7

- Climbing the LeaderBoard
- Viral Advertising
- Beautiful Days at the Movies
- Angry Professor
- Utopian Tree
- Designer PDF Viewer
- The Hurdle Race

Back with Hackerrank challenges! Today I got stuck with the "Climbing the LeaderBoard" challenge for quite some time...! My logic is right but 4 of the sample keep getting runtime error, after some googling it had something to do with "Big O notation". Cuz I was looping one array inside another array which is O(n * n), it will slow down when n gets too big...?! Anyway, still not fully understanding the concept yet, but I know I need to somehow loop through both array at the same time to compare them. So, I finally found that I can do this:

```javascript
// loop both array in nested for loop  
// but put both starting point on the outside loop  
for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < n; n++) {
    for (; j < m; j++) {
        // code goes here...
    }
}
// this way j will not reset every time i go up!
```

totally did not know I can do that...! üòÖ

Today I also finished my PS5 product landing page for freeCodeCamp's project. It was fun!

**Thoughts:**  Need to find better tutorial to get the "Big O notation" concept!! ü§î
