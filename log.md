### Day 002: March 02, 2020 MON

**Today's Progress:** Implementing the express-ejs-layouts package üëçüèº, and focus on the front-end views today. Sort out the landing page's layout using the CSS grid. Research on RESTful API and MVC architecture, see if I can implementing it in this small project.  

**Thoughts:** CSS grid is way more easy to use than flexbox?! Took me awhile try to use flex, but somethings just not right so eventually, I just switch to use grid...!

### Day 004: March 04, 2020 WED

**Today's Progress:** Found a npm package called [popular-movie-quotes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/popular-movie-quotes) which I use it to generate random movie quote on my landing page. üòú And then I work on how to get the Date in js and show it on the page in the format I want. Also, did a bit CSS to play with the text input field!

**Thoughts:** It's fun to search for the npm that can help me do some stuff I want!
