## My First Round's Log: 🤞🏼

### Day 001: March 01, 2020 SUN

**Today's Progress:**  
Started a new project with node.js and set up the project folder structure. Sorted out the DB connection and HTML skeleton.

### Day 002: March 02, 2020 MON

**Today's Progress:**  
Implementing the express-ejs-layouts package 👍🏼, and focus on the front-end views today. Sort out the landing page's layout using the CSS grid. Research on RESTful API and MVC architecture, see if I can implementing it in this small project.  

**Thoughts:** CSS grid is way more easy to use than flexbox?! Took me awhile try to use flex, but somethings just not right so eventually, I just switch to use grid...!

**Today's Progress:**  
Focus on the front-end views again. Sort out the landing page's layout and make it RWD. Research on CSS variables and @media function.

### Day 004: March 04, 2020 WED

**Today's Progress:**  
Found a npm package called [popular-movie-quotes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/popular-movie-quotes) which I use it to generate random movie quote on my landing page. 😜 And then I work on how to get the Date in js and show it on the page in the format I want. Also, did a bit CSS to play with the text input field!

**Thoughts:** It's fun to search for the npm that can help me do some stuff I want!
