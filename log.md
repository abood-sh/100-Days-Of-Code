Implementing the express-ejs-layouts package üëçüèº, and focus on the front-end views today. Sort out the landing page's layout using the CSS grid. Research on RESTful API and MVC architecture, see if I can implementing it in this small project.  

**Thoughts:** CSS grid is way more easy to use than flexbox?! Took me awhile try to use flex, but somethings just not right so eventually, I just switch to use grid...!

- Climbing the LeaderBoard
- Viral Advertising
- Beautiful Days at the Movies
- Angry Professor
- Utopian Tree
- Designer PDF Viewer
- The Hurdle Race

Back with Hackerrank challenges! Today I got stuck with the "Climbing the LeaderBoard" challenge for quite some time...! My logic is right but 4 of the sample keep getting runtime error, after some googling it had something to do with "Big O notation". Cuz I was looping one array inside another array which is O(n * n), it will slow down when n gets too big...?! Anyway, still not fully understanding the concept yet, but I know I need to somehow loop through both array at the same time to compare them. So, I finally found that I can do this:

```javascript
// loop both array in nested for loop  
// but put both starting point on the outside loop  
for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < n; n++) {
    for (; j < m; j++) {
        // code goes here...
    }
}
// this way j will not reset every time i go up!
```

totally did not know I can do that...! üòÖ

Today I also finished my PS5 product landing page for freeCodeCamp's project. It was fun!

**Thoughts:**  Need to find better tutorial to get the "Big O notation" concept!! ü§î

- Take a Number And Sum Its Digits Raised To The Consecutive Powers And ....¬°Eureka!!

**Thoughts:** Today I went through a bunch YouTube tutorials to see which front-end framework should I start learning. **React.js** vs **Vue.js** ? ü§îI decided to try **Vue.js** first because it actually seems much friendly to beginners. Cuz you can still just write in HTML & CSS, and not suddenly jump to write everything inside JS. 

P.S. The Net Ninja's "[Vue JS 2 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQcYgjhBoeQH7wiAyZNrYa)" seems pretty easy to grasp!!!

Maybe I can start try to implements those function I solved into some kinda small webapp? Like some simple calculations?!

**Thoughts:** Today I finished the SignUp Form challenge from Frontend Mentor, I finally start using JS for DOM manipulation. Because the :invalid input state had some issue with type="text" fields, it will fire right at the beginning which is not what we want. So, instead I use "blur" event to setAttribute "required" to the input fields to show the error message after user finished with the field to check its validation.

Went to the interview today, it seems like it's going well but you never know?! Definitely did not prepare well enough for the Java test...! üò≠ Hope they see my potential and give me a chance...! Let's wait & see!!!

- String incrementer

Taking it easy today, not feel like coding much so just went on Codewars to solved a Kata. Again with some String manipulation, although I did solved it but it's not the most clean way to do it obviously. So I really think I need to study more about the recursive function, so I can code cleaner solutions.ü§î
