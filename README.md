* [Resources](resources.md)

## If you've decided to join:

1.  Check out [the Official Site](http://100daysofcode.com/) for the #100DaysOfCode movement. Connect with others on the platform of your choice from this list: www.100DaysOfCode.com/connect. Also, [here](https://100xcode.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtOTE0NjE3Nzc3ODg4LTY0NDliODc5YWYyODc1OWVmNTllYWRhMDZmMTQwMmI3MTY0N2UxYWQwYjRiMjEzZTI0ZTIzYTdkNWY4MWM5MzE) is a invite link to the 100DaysOfCode Slack channel.
2.  Fork [the original repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and commit to the [Log](log.md) daily.
3.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4.  Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!
5.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
6.  Follow [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
7.  Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
8.  If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
